## Capyboo – Desk Companion Robot

Capyboo is a cute, calm desk companion robot designed to sit on your table and keep you company.
With a small display, expressive animations, and gentle interactions, Capyboo brings a relaxing and friendly presence to your workspace.

Built as a fun blend of hardware + software, Capyboo focuses on personality, simplicity, and delightful user experience rather than complexity.

2. **Weather Mode** - Shows current weather information including city name, temperature, humidity, and weather description on the display.

3. **Game Mode** - Play a fun Dino game! Jump over obstacles by pressing the touch sensor. Perfect for quick breaks during work.
